A simple program to check the effect of precision in the direct and reverse summation of a number N of floats.
The program computes both the exact summation of a large number of integers based on Gauss formula n*(n+1)/2.
The sum is then performed for float numbers both in direct and reverse order

Check the program output for different orders of N and compiler optimization options.
What happens if double precision is considered ?
