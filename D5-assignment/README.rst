Tasks
=====

Task 1
------

Simulate and plot the trajectory of a point mass which is gravitationally attracted by a fixed central mass. Choose interesting initial conditions to show a circular, elliptical and hyperbolic orbit.

The plot does not have to be animated.

Task 2
------

Initial conditions should be read interactively from the user, with sensible default values pre-set.

Task 3
------

Allow the position of the central body to vary, too. Plot several interesting binary star systems.

Task 4
------

Introduce a planet into your binary star system.

Task 5
------

Make your program flexible enough to deal with an arbitrary number of bodies, 
selectable by the end user through a configuration file.
